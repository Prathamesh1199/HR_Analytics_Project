# HR_Analytics_Project

# Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of employee attrition in a company based on the provided HR dataset. The dataset includes various factors such as age, daily rate, job satisfaction, and more, collected from a group of employees. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition and provide actionable insights for the company.

# Repository Contents
Jupyter Notebook: The core analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook. It covers data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and machine learning techniques to understand employee attrition better.

Data: The raw dataset (HR-Employee-Attrition.csv) is included in the repository.

# Key Findings
Attrition Patterns: Analyzed attrition rates based on different factors such as overtime, job role, education level, and more. Discovered significant patterns and trends in employee turnover.

Correlation Analysis: Explored correlations between various numeric variables, identifying relationships that might influence attrition.

Data Visualization: Created visualizations, including heatmaps, count plots, and box plots, to effectively communicate insights and trends related to attrition.

Machine Learning (SMOTE): Applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance and enhance machine learning model accuracy in predicting attrition.
